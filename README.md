# Static-Page
HTML , CSS
The provided HTML code creates a well-structured, simple static webpage that features a contact form, ideal for beginners to understand basic HTML and CSS concepts. The page begins with the standard HTML5 document declaration, which includes the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration to specify HTML5 and the root <html> element with the lang="en" attribute for English. The <head> section includes essential meta tags: <meta charset="UTF-8"> ensures proper character encoding, and <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> ensures the page is responsive across different devices. The <title> tag sets the browser tab title to "Simple Static Page with Contact Form." Inside the <style> tag, CSS rules define the page's look and feel. The body is styled with a font-family of Arial, a light background color (#e9ecef), and reset margins and paddings for a clean slate. The header element, styled with a background color of #007bff and white text, creates a prominent top section with centered content for the page title. The main section, which holds the core content, is centered on the page with a maximum width of 900 pixels, a white background, and a box-shadow to give it a card-like appearance. The main section also features rounded corners and padding for a clean, spacious look. Inside the main section, the <h2> heading introduces the contact form, which is organized into a form element that includes fields for user input. The form is styled to display its contents in a columnar layout with labels and input fields spaced out appropriately. Labels are given margin to separate them from input fields, which are styled with padding, a light border, and rounded corners. Input fields for text, email, and textarea are adjusted for readability and consistency. The textarea is set with a height of 5 rows for user input. A submit button is styled with a green background (#28a745) and white text, with a hover effect that darkens the button color to #218838 for interactive feedback. The footer element is fixed at the bottom of the page, providing a consistent place for copyright information. It has a background color matching the header, ensuring visual cohesion. Overall, this code demonstrates fundamental HTML and CSS practices, including layout design, form creation, styling, and responsiveness, making it an excellent example for beginners to learn about static web page development.
